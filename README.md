# Inventory Management and Order Fulfillment System for a Retail Business
<P>The problem involves managing inventory, processing customer orders, and ensuring timely fulfillment 
for a retail business with multiple warehouses and an online store. The system must handle complex 
business logic, such as inventory allocation across warehouses, backorder management, and real-time 
stock updates. The current manual process is error-prone, 
leading to stockouts, delayed shipments, and customer dissatisfaction.
